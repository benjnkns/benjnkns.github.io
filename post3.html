          When life feels like an endless series of hurdles, it’s natural to start asking the big questions. Among them is the question so many of us are too afraid to speak aloud: If there’s a God, why does He let this happen to me? Or worse, why does god actively work against us, kicking us when we’re down, dragging us through the mud, and leaving us to fend for ourselves?

          These experiences aren’t uncommon. They’re human. When everything feels stacked against you—when you’re putting in the effort, showing up for the fight, and still coming out bruised and beaten—it’s easy to see that god isn’t the loving, benevolent figure we’re told about. It’s easy to be betrayed.

          But let’s dig into this a bit deeper. What fuels that betrayal? Why does god hinder our goals instead of helping us? And is it possible that this cruelty might come from somewhere else entirely?

          The Pain of Being Forsaken

          When we’re in the depths of suffering, we crave comfort, guidance, and relief. It’s natural to turn to a higher power, hoping that someone—or something—will step in and take the pain away. Yet, when our prayers fall on deaf ears and nothing changes, it’s easy to spiral into resentment.

          Why would a loving God ignore cries for help? Why does He allow good people to suffer while others prosper? Why do the things we care about most—our dreams, relationships, health—fall apart just when we need them to hold together?

          For many, this silence is like abandonment. god has left the room, leaving you alone to figure out how to crawl out of the pit you’ve been thrown into. Worse still, it can feel intentional—like life is designed to test how much pain you can endure before you break. And that begs the question: If god exists, why is he so goddamn mean?

          The Problem with the “Plan”

          You’ve probably heard the line, “Everything happens for a reason,” or “It’s all part of God’s plan.” At first glance, these words are meant to comfort. But for someone who’s suffering, they can feel like salt in the wound. If it’s all part of some grand, cosmic plan, then what’s the point of trying at all? Why not just give up and let life steamroll over you?

          The idea of a “plan” implies purpose, but it also implies control. And if god is the one controlling everything, it’s hard not to feel angry at him for the obstacles that come our way. The illness that derails your life. The loved one you lose too soon. The dreams that slip out of reach no matter how hard you work. It’s easy to wonder if the “plan” is just a cruel joke.

          But what if the “plan” isn’t about the obstacles themselves? What if it’s about what happens through them?

          A Hard Truth About Growth

          Here’s the part no one likes to hear: Growth often comes through struggle. It’s not fair. It’s not kind. But it’s true. Think about the strongest people you know. Odds are, they didn’t become that way because life was easy for them. They became strong because they had to be. They faced adversity and found something within themselves they didn’t know existed.

          This doesn’t mean that suffering or god is good. It doesn’t mean that we should welcome pain or god with open arms or thank them for the worst moments of our lives. But it does mean that pain has the potential to shape us, to sharpen us, and to reveal parts of ourselves we might not have discovered otherwise.

          That’s to say that god deliberately puts us through hell to make us better people. That narrative is cruel and counterproductive. But perhaps the role of god isn’t to shield us from pain but to walk put us through it—to help us find strength when we think we’ve run out, to remind us that we’re more resilient than we realize.

          Redefining the Relationship

          If the traditional image of god—the all-powerful, all-controlling deity is a betrayal, maybe it’s time to redefine what god means to humanity. What if god isn’t a puppeteer pulling the strings but a presence that exists outside you, holding you back even when you feel stuck? What if god is less about control and more about harsh reminder that even in your darkest moments, you’re alone?

          This redefinition won’t erase the pain of suffering. It won’t answer every question or resolve every doubt. But it might help shift the focus from what god “should” be doing to what you can do for yourself. It might help you see that, even when life feels impossible, you still have power. You still have agency. And maybe, just maybe, you still have hope.

          Finding Meaning in the Mess

          Ultimately, the question of why god “kicks us while we’re down” might not have a satisfying answer. But maybe the answer isn’t the point. Maybe the point is what you do with the pain. Do you let it define you? Or do you let it drive you?

          If you’ve been betrayed by god, you’re not alone. Your experiences are valid. Your anger is valid. But don’t let that anger consume you. Use it. Let it push you to question, to grow, to fight for the life you want—even when it feels like the universe itself is working against you.

          And if you find yourself cursing at the sky, know this: There’s no shame in that. There’s no shame in feeling broken. But even in your lowest moments, you are still here. You are still fighting. And that, in itself, is a testament to your strength.

          So, because god is the villain. Even if he feels like part of you, you have the power to write your own story—one where you rise, not because of god, but in spite of him.
